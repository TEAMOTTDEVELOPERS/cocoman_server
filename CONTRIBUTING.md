## Team OTT Contributing Guidelines
### How to contribute

1. Fork https://github.com/TEAMOTTDEVELOPERS/cocoman_server
2. Register work as an issue, then discuss with other maintainers. Or you can choose exsiting issue
3. Assign yourself or other maintainers at each issue, then work on your assigned work
4. After work, create pull request to `develop` branch with issue number and description
5. More than one approve from other maintainers is needed, then the pr can be merged to the develop branch
6. When you merge the pr from other maintainers, please **rebase and merge**. Moreover, **do not merge your pull request yourself**


### Rules to manage branch
- `master` : project with *release level* can be merged to `master` branch
- `develop` : new feature developed after verifing from others can be merged to `develop` branch


### Branch naming rule
> *(type)*: *(description)* 


**Sample**

> docs: create templete

> feat: add user model


**Available types**
- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: changes to documentation
- chore: extra work without code change
- refactor: refactoring production code, only code change
- test: all about tests
